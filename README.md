# Regex-Engine

This project involves building a Regular Expression (Regex) Engine from scratch, starting with a basic NFA Architecture and gradually adding advanced features such as Lookaheads, Backreferences, and Multithreading support. The main focus is on performance optimization - to create a powerful tool that can handle even the most complex pattern matching tasks with high efficiency.
